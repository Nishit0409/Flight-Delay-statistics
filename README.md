# Flight-Delay-statistics
The dataset contains observations of US domestic flights in 2013, and consists of the following fields:
This project centers on uncovering insights from flight data to identify factors that contribute to delays in departure and arrival. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of potential causes behind these delays for improved operational understanding and decision-making within the aviation industry.

Key Steps:

Data Cleaning:

Detect and address null or missing data points by imputing relevant values.
Mitigate data anomalies by identifying and removing outliers within the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.
Exploratory Analysis:

Examine summary statistics of numerical fields to gain an overview of the dataset's characteristics.
Investigate the distribution of departure and arrival delays through visualizations and summary metrics.
Analytical Insights:

Calculate average departure and arrival delays to quantify typical delays.
Compare carriers' arrival delay performance to identify variations.
Assess days of the week for trends in arrival delays.
Determine the departure airport with the highest average delay.
Analyze the correlation between late departures and subsequent arrival delays.
Pinpoint routes with the most instances of late arrivals.
Identify routes with the highest average arrival delays.
Project Impact:

By delving into these analyses, the project aims to shed light on critical aspects affecting flight delays, including airline performance, departure times, and route characteristics. The findings will enable aviation professionals to make data-informed decisions for enhancing operational efficiency, resource allocation, and passenger experiences. Ultimately, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricacies of flight delays and supports efforts to mitigate their impact on airline operations and customer satisfaction.
